## About BuckshotCord
So this is a bot that I created while on holiday in about three days (my excuse for the spaghetti code), to mimic the gameplay of the popular game 'Buckshot Roulette' (created by Mike Klubnika), but with multiplayer instead of PvE. I chose to do this as a discord bot because it is the easiest way for it to reach a large user base as a multiplayer game and because I'm also proficient (ish) with the Pycord library, so it would be a fairly simple task to complete. I'm going to start commenting this code at some point, just... not now because I have... *other things to attend to*.

## Dependencies
This bot has only one dependency and that is [Pycord](https://pycord.dev). The latest version is preferable, since I have found some elements of this bot to not work with older versions of the library.
